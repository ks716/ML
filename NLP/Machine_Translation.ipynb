Neural Machine Translation\n","\n","Here, you will build an English-to-German neural machine translation (NMT) model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention.  Machine translation is an important task in natural language processing and could be useful not only for translating one language to another but also for word sense disambiguation (e.g. determining whether the word \"bank\" refers to the financial bank, or the land alongside a river). Implementing this using just a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTMs can work for short to medium length sentences but can result in vanishing gradients for very long sequences. To solve this, you will be adding an attention mechanism to allow the decoder to access all relevant parts of the input sentence regardless of its length.

If storage is not an issue, you can opt to get a larger corpus such as the English to German translation dataset from [ParaCrawl](https://paracrawl.eu/), a large multi-lingual translation dataset created by the European Union.

For our application, we will use *subword* representations to tokenize our sentences.

For example, instead of having separate entries in your vocabulary for --\"fear\", \"fearless\", \"fearsome\", \"some\", and \"less\"--, you can simply store --\"fear\", \"some\", and \"less\"-- then allow your tokenizer to combine these subwords when needed. This allows it to be more flexible so you won't have to save uncommon words explicitly in your vocabulary (e.g. *stylebender*, *nonce*, etc).

As mentioned in the lectures, just using a a regular sequence-to-sequence model with LSTMs will work effectively for short to medium sentences but will start to degrade for longer ones. You can picture it like the figure below where all of the context of the input sentence is compressed into one vector that is passed into the decoder block. You can see how this will be an issue for very long sentences (e.g. 100 tokens or more) because the context of the first parts of the input will have very little effect on the final vector passed to the decoder.\n","\n","<img src='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lxQPrDy0UsMiHKp1R9gxS7HNuXNctUoM/view?usp=sharing'>\n","\n","Adding an attention layer to this model avoids this problem by giving the decoder access to all parts of the input sentence. To illustrate, let's just use a 4-word input sentence as shown below. Remember that a hidden state is produced at each timestep of the encoder (represented by the orange rectangles). These are all passed to the attention layer and each are given a score given the current activation (i.e. hidden state) of the decoder. For instance, let's consider the figure below where the first prediction \"Wie\" is already made. To produce the next prediction, the attention layer will first receive all the encoder hidden states (i.e. orange rectangles) as well as the decoder hidden state when producing the word \"Wie\" (i.e. first green rectangle). Given these information, it will score each of the encoder hidden states to know which one the decoder should focus on to produce the next word. The result of the model training might have learned that it should align to the second encoder hidden state and subsequently assigns a high probability to the word \"geht\". If we are using greedy decoding, we will output the said word as the next symbol, then restart the process to produce the next word until we reach an end-of-sentence prediction.\n","\n","<img src='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vfe81xYUzcsqQOxc__sWSJYvM_5DuKTA/view?usp=sharing'>\n","\n","\n","There are different ways to implement attention and the one we'll use for this assignment is the Scaled Dot Product Attention which has the form:\n","\n","$$Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V$$\n","\n","You will dive deeper into this equation in the next week but for now, you can think of it as computing scores using queries (Q) and keys (K), followed by a multiplication of values (V) to get a context vector at a particular timestep of the decoder.

The division by square root of the keys dimensionality ($\\sqrt{d_k}$) is for improving model performance and you'll also learn more about it next week.

You have already defined this earlier as helper functions so it's just a matter of calling those functions and assigning it to variables.\n","\n","**Step 1:** Create a Serial network. This will stack the layers in the next steps one after the other. Like the earlier exercises, you can use [tl.Serial](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Serial).\n","\n","**Step 2:** Make a copy of the input and target tokens. As you see in the diagram above, the input and target tokens will be fed into different layers of the model. You can use [tl.Select](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Select) layer to create copies of these tokens. Arrange them as `[input tokens, target tokens, input tokens, target tokens]`.\n","\n","**Step 3:** Create a parallel branch to feed the input tokens to the `input_encoder` and the target tokens to the `pre_attention_decoder`. You can use [tl.Parallel](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Parallel) to create these sublayers in parallel. Remember to pass the variables you defined in Step 0 as parameters to this layer.\n","\n","**Step 4:** Next, call the `prepare_attention_input` function to convert the encoder and pre-attention decoder activations to a format that the attention layer will accept. You can use [tl.Fn](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.base.Fn) to call this function.

This computes the scaled dot product attention and outputs the attention weights and mask. Take note that although it is a one liner, this layer is actually composed of a deep network made up of several branches.

You can do this in trax by simply nesting the `AttentionQKV` layer inside the `Residual` layer. The library will take care of branching and adding for you.\n","\n","**Step 6:** We will not need the mask for the model we're building so we can safely drop it.
